  <h1>Hello! My Name is Kelly Norian</h1>

  <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
     <p>I am a driven BBA student at UW-Madison pursuing a dual degree in Operations and Technology Management and Supply Chain Management with an anticipated graduation date of December 2021. My pronouns are she/her/hers. I am from San Francisco, CA but my love for adventure and facing new experiences brought me to the Midwest.</p>
     <p>I am an innovative thinker and an analytical problem solver. I am skilled in process improvements, data visualization, and waste reduction and well-versed in market trends and customer engagement techniques. While my background is technical, I have a love for art and creativity which has motivated me to also pursue a certificate in Textiles and Design. I find working in teams on multi-faceted issues very rewarding. I am adaptable to change and I thrive in ambiguity.</p>
     <p>I hope to pursue a career related to supply chain management once I graduate, and I am especially interested in evolving the ways in which brand strategy and aesthetics aligns with logistics and fulfillment methods within a company.</p>

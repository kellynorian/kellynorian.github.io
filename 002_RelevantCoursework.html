  <h2>Procurement</h2>
    <p>Critically analyzed organizations spend to make recommendations regarding whether a company should produce a product in-house or outsource. Used excel to evaluate how cost drivers (e.g. labor, overhead, freight, energy, exchange rate, etc.) may change over time to calculate NPV and ROI.</p>
  <p>Applied various sourcing methods including but not limited to request for proposal (RFP) construction, on-line auctions, and cost takeout strategies with incumbent suppliers.</p>
  <h2>Data Analysis and Visualization in RStudio and Tableau</h2>
    <p> Applied data-based forecasting methods to evaluate the performance of such methods on operations decisions such as accurately forecasting demand. Then engineered spreadsheet models for decision-support leveraging optimization and simulation tools.</p>
    <p> Explored data to identify patterns and relationships that provide insights into real business problems. One case study I worked on utilized the fashion company Rent the Runway's Data where I was instructed to find insight about demand. Using R, I parsed customer review text to find insight on the driving factors for outfit rentals. To do so I used a text correlation analysis to find the words most frequently correlated with the word “party” in the customer reviews where I uncovered that bachelorette, holiday, and company parties were the most common. From there I then identified the most frequent item IDs being rented for each of these party types, as well as the size, fit, and category of dress. Lastly, exported findings to Tableau to emphasize key findings visually and filter multiple charts/graphs through dashboards.</p>
  <h2>Operations Management</h2>
    <p> Determined effective inventory policies for various product and customer demand characteristics.</p>
    <p> Analyzed real manufacturing and service processes to quantitatively generate opportunities for improvement. Learned the principles of lean manufacturing to better understand how to identify waste or variability in a process or service and suggest ways to mitigate its effects.</p>
  <h2>Experience with SAP ERP Software</h2>
    <p>Played an ERP Simulation Game over several months, where I was put into a team and we had to run a business with a real-life SAP system. Interacted with suppliers and customers by sending and receiving orders, delivering products and completing the entire cash‐to‐cash cycle. When making important decisions we exported reports from SAP to analyze transactional data and ensure profitability of our operations.</p>
  <h2>Logistics Management</h2>
    <p>Used supply chain data to make business decisions including distribution, transportation, global logistics and inventory control. In a case study called Quad Graphics, analyzed a companies data to optimize transportation routes across the US and mode selection (LTL, TL, intermodal) subject to delivery service windows and load planning constraints (pallet weights).</p>
  <h2>Excel Proficiency</h2>
<p> Skills include but not limited to:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Conditional Formating</li>
      <li>VLOOKUP</li>
